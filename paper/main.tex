\section{Introduction \& Related Work}
In 2008 a technical Whitepaper was pseudonymously released (\citet{bitcoin}). Taking elements from peer-to-peer and cryptographic technology and combining them into the idea of a distributed ledger called the Blockchain, it described the first truly decentralized currency: Bitcoin. Since then, global interest in the capabilities and possibilities for Blockchain technologies has grown immensely. Meanwhile the underlying technology has also evolved a lot and, by now, is used for many more things than the creation of mere currencies. Despite this, the nature of the need for a type of "Currency" in the context of the Blockchain validation mechanics, has brought forth an ever-growing number of Cryptocurrencies and tokens, which are freely traded in centralized and decentralized exchanges and due to their relative lack of regulation and immense volatility, have attracted investors, traders and speculators on a global scale. \\
